This is an unofficial version of Anders Melander's TGIFImage ported to Delphi 6.
It supports animated GIF files in Delphi 6.

Note: This Delphi 6 version should also work older Delphi versions (not tested much).

WARNING: Use it at your own risc.

I'm posting it with permission from the author Anders Melander.

Anders Melander is still working on an official release for Delphi6.
